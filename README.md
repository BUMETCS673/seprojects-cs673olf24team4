TeamBuilder is a team assignment tool to help create teams based on a few simple, but important questions that users will answer. The motivation and purpose to create this tool is to make a team where collaboration, inclusivity, efficiency, and flexibility are emphasized to help users become more productive and engaging, improving overall team performance. The potential users are any group of people who want to form separate teams. The application will work as so: the user will get on the website, they will answer a few questions, and they will be placed into a team according to their answers and the answers of others.

## Overview

TeamBuilder is a web-based application that allows users to:

1. Answer a series of questions
2. Be automatically assigned to a team based on their responses and the responses of others
3. View their team assignment

The primary motivation behind TeamBuilder is to streamline the team formation process and create more effective teams across various contexts.
